# IoT-Malware-Analysis-Graph-Embeddings-Similarity

This repository contains the implementation of a system for computing similarities between IoT malware samples using Control-Flow Graphs (CFGs) and graph embeddings. This code accompanies the research paper titled "Unveiling Hidden Structures: Multi-Platform IoT Malware Analysis Using Graph Embeddings".

## Overview

The system computes similarities between Control-Flow Graph (CFG) embeddings extracted from IoT malware binaries. The similarities are calculated using cosine similarity and matched using either a greedy algorithm or the Hungarian algorithm.

## Features

- **Greedy Algorithm**: Finds the best matching similarities using a greedy approach.
- **Hungarian Algorithm**: Finds the optimal assignment of similarities using the Hungarian algorithm.
- **Similarity Computation**: Computes node, edge, and graph similarities and saves the results to CSV files.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/remuspetrache/IoT-Malware-Analysis-Graph-Embeddings-Similarity.git
   cd IoT-Malware-Analysis-Graph-Embeddings-Similarity\IOTMalwareSimilarity 
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

## Usage

To compute similarities between malware samples, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your embeddings data. Ensure you have the embeddings for nodes, edges, and graphs.

2. Modify the `main` function in `similarity.py` to point to your data.

3. Run the script:
	```bash
	python similarity.py
	```
